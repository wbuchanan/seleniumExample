# Using Selenium Web Driver for Scraping and Testing
Contains a current example showing how Selenium can be used to simulate interaction with web application to either scrape results from web pages that obfuscate their data or to test the performance of the application.

Given the current house searching stuff going on I decided to tailor the example a bit closer to that application.  Although the architecture used by that application is some type of .NET framework application that tries to completely hide all of the data elements and prevent direct input of values to fields, working through this to find a solution will be useful for other modern web architectures that manipulate shadow DOM elements as well.
